# javascript-koans
This is a project I completed as part of the precourse work for [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).

This repo is based on Edgecase's [Ruby Koans](https://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans). The goal of JavaScript Koans was to teach JavaScript through testing.  The repo contained a bunch of failing tests, and I had to fix bugs in the JS code and implement missing parts to make all of the tests pass.
